# City Climate Finder
Comparing detailed climate data for cities, looking for similar ones in different continents.

If you have ever wondered which cities would have a similar climate to your hometown, you might be tempted to look up a world map of [climate zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification). However, these climates are fairly broadly defined so cities with quite different climates can end up in the same zone. Also, due to the hard boundary between climate zones, border cities (like Frankfurt or Philadelphia) can have cities in a different climate zone that are more similar to them than others in their own zone. 

In this project we try to answer these questions using climate data from [Weatherbase.com](https://www.weatherbase.com/).
